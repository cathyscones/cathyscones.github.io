<h1>CIS128: Mobile Web App Development</h1>

<p><img src="Cathy_profile.jpg" alt="Cathy Cohn profile photo"> </p>

<p> I am a Navy veteran and former high school physics teacher. I live in the redwoods of the Santa Cruz mountains, and love to hike, cook, and read in my free time. I am married and have three daughters. I also have two Australian Shepherds who are full of energy and love to hike, too!</p>

<p>I am taking this class because I have taken a few semesters of backend programming, and now I'm eager to learn a little bit more of front end development. I started taking courses at CSM because I was interested in transitioning to a career in data science, and so I started learning python, then java. Now I am working at an AI startup that develops many web applications and I think learning a bit more about web app development will help me better understand what the developers I work with do, which will in turn help me do my job on the product team better. </p>
