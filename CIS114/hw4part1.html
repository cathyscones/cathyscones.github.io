    <h2>Looping Statements for Arithmetic Calculations</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will demonstrate some basic arithmetic calculations performed using JavaScript loops.</p>
    <br>
  
     <h3>In this example, we'll use a for loop to calculate the product and sum of every 4th integer from 5 to 25.</h3>

     <!--  script using the for statement that calculates the product and sum of every fourth integer from 5 to 25 inclusive.-->
    <script>
        let product, sum;
        product = 1;
        sum = 0;	
    
        for (x=5; x<=25; x+=4) {
          product *= x;
          sum += x;	
         }
          product = product.toLocaleString();
          sum = sum.toLocaleString();
         
         document.write(`<p>The result of 5 * 9 * 13 * 17 * 21 * 25 is ${product}.</p>`);
         document.write(`<p>The result of 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25 is ${sum}.</p>`);
     </script>

     <h3>In this example, we'll use a while loop to calculate the product and sum of every 3rd integer from 3 to 18.</h3>
     
    <!--  script using a while loop that calculates the product and sum of every third integer from 3 to 18 inclusive.-->
    <script>
        let product, sum, x;
        product = 1;
        sum = 0;
        x = 3;
    
        while (x<=18) {
          product *= x;
          sum += x;	
          x = x+3;
         }
          product = product.toLocaleString();
          sum = sum.toLocaleString();
         
         document.write(`<p>The result of 3 * 6 * 9 * 12 * 15 * 18 is ${product}.</p>`);
         document.write(`<p>The result of 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 is ${sum}.</p>`);
     </script>
