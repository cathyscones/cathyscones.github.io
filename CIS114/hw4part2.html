    <h2>Learn about compound interest!</h2>
    <br>
  <p>If you invest $1000, your money will grow exponentially over time. See how much money you will have at a variety of interest rates.</p>
     <!--  Below the heading you will code a script to show 3 tables with the calculation of compound interest on a principal of $1000.

The first table will be for the interest rate of 5%
The second table will be for the interest rate of 6%
The third table will be for the interest rate of 7%
Each of the tables will show the rows from year 1 through 5.-->
