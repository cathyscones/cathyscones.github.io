                <h2>Hybrid Application Tools</h2>
                <p>Although web applications offer great functionality and the ability to work offline, native applications have significant appeal 
                    in the mobile web development arena, as they can offer sleek UI, faster rendering, and greater interaction with other native components like a mobile photo album or camera. 
                This page offers a glimpse of some of the history, features, and advantages of each of the three most popular native and hybrid-native web development tools available. </p>

                                <p>PhoneGap was one of the first native app development platforms, acquired by Adobe and released in 2011.
                                This open source tool allows developers to use a single JavaScript API to write code that enables hybrid app 
                                development across all mobile operating systems. It also allows integration with mobile tools such as a cell phone
                                camera. Although PhoneGap offered developers a novel tool for hybrid app development for nearly a decade, Adobe 
                                retired the platform in 2020 due to decreasing popularity and the influx of other hybrid native development tools. 
                                Still, to this day there are some online support materials like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/phonegap/index.htm" aria-label="Tutorials Point PhoneGap overview">this PhoneGap tutorial</a> that can help developers work with the platform in spite of discontinued support from Adobe.

                              <p>Flutter is an open source native app development tool developed by Google. It has several appealing benefits to the developer, 
                                from the ability to seamlessly integrate across iOS and Android platforms to a built-in widget library. Flutter offers many of the 
                                same benefits as PhoneGap, but with more capability like its own SDK to allow developers to compile native-style apps across different 
                                mobile platforms using a single codebase. The widget based design also makes it easier for programmers to do UI design right in their 
                                Flutter program. One of the disadvantages of Flutter is the inherent challenges in interoperability with iOS, but even so, the developer 
                                community is strong and the Flutter support documentation covers <a href= "https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios" aria-label = "Flutter iOS Support">detailed support for iOS development</a>.

                            <p>React Native is currently the preferred framework for native app development for many developers. 
                              Like Flutter, it offers cross platform compatibility which is very useful when designing programs to work on both Android and iOS. 
                              Based on the React JS framework, React Native was also created by Meta (Facebook) and is very popular among developers due to its 
                              versatility, compatibility, and design features. React's popularity is predominantly due to its ability to create true native apps - 
                              not hybrid - using a single codebase. Unlike other similar tools, it utilizes native functionality on each platform which makes it closer 
                              to a traditionally native-built app than a progressive web application or hybrid app. Finally, React Native is supported by a strong and 
                              knowledgeable <a href="https://reactnative.dev/community/overview" aria-label="React Native online community">community</a>.
