            <h1>July 2020: Jalalabad in the Crosshairs</h1>
            <p>
                The Rhombus team worked hard to improve the models to deliver decision advantage to the troops on the battlefield. For example, in July 2020, Raven Sentry warned of an upcoming violent attack in Jalalabad, the capital of the eastern Nangarhar province, that would probably cause between 20-40 casualties. The attack came on August 2nd and killed 29 people.
            </p>
            <p>This wasn't an isolated incident. By October 2020, Raven Sentry maintained 70% accuracy and was trusted by senior military decision-makers.
            </p>
            <p><i>The results were striking,</i> said Colonel Spahr, who was chief of staff to the top intelligence at the NATO mission in Afghanistan at the time.</p>
