            <h1>A Surge in Violence. A Shrinking Footprint.</h1>
            <p>
              In late 2019, U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan faced a conundrum:
              Taliban attacks were spikingâ€”at their highest level in over a decade.
              But troops were drawing down. Bases were closing. Resources were diverted elsewhere.</p>
             <p>The cost of being reactive was too high. Commanders needed foresight. Traditional intel couldn't keep up.
