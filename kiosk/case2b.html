            <h1>The Synthetic Opioid Epidemic</h1>
            <p>In the late 2010's, illicit fentanyl overdoses in the US were surging. With the increased demand, Mexican drug trafficking organizations focused on fentanyl production. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid made of licit chemicals, which can be purchased legally through reputable sources and misused to produce this deadly drug. 
            </p>
            <p>This — combined with the rise of cryptocurrency and the dark web, which made it easier for individuals to buy shady goods and services without detection— made tracking the actors and activities involved in the illicit fentanyl supply chain nearly impossible.
            </p>
            <p>US law enforcement and intelligence agencies realized their traditional tactics wouldn't work against this insurmountable challenge.
